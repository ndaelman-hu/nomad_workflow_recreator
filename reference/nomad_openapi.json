The NOMAD Archive is a hierarchical data format and\nyou can *require* certain branches (i.e. *sections*) in the hierarchy.\nBy specifying certain sections with specific contents or all contents (via\nthe directive `\"*\"`), you can determine what sections and what quantities should\nbe returned. The default is the whole archive, i.e., `\"*\"`.\n\nFor example to specify that you are only interested in the `metadata`\nuse:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"metadata\": \"*\"\n}\n```\n\nOr to only get the `energy_total` from each individual entry, use:\n```json\n{\n    \"run\": {\n        \"configuration\": {\n            \"energy\": \"*\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also request certain parts of a list, e.g. the last calculation:\n```json\n{\n    \"run\": {\n        \"calculation[-1]\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese required specifications are also very useful to get workflow results.\nThis works because we can use references (e.g. workflow to final result calculation)\nand the API will resolve these references and return the respective data.\nFor example just the total energy value and reduced formula from the resulting\ncalculation:\n```json\n{\n    \"workflow\": {\n        \"calculation_result_ref\": {\n            \"energy\": \"*\",\n            \"system_ref\": {\n                \"value\": {\n                    \"chemical_composition\": \"*\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also resolve all references in a branch with the `include-resolved`\ndirective. This will resolve all references in the branch, and also all references\nin referenced sections:\n```json\n{\n    \"workflow\":\n        \"calculation_result_ref\": \"include-resolved\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, the targets of \"resolved\" references are added to the archive at\ntheir original hierarchy positions.\nThis means, all references are still references, but they are resolvable within\nthe returned data, since they targets are now part of the data.
